Step 1: Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

Select AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average 
FROM
(Select A.customer_id , A.first_name , A.last_name,
D.country , C.city,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM
customer A JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON C.city_id = B.city_id
JOIN country D ON D.country_id = C.country_id
JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
Where city IN (
SELECT city
FROM customer A
JOIN address E ON A.address_id = E.address_id
JOIN city C ON E.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid 

 Step 2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country:
SELECT  D.country ,
COUNT(DISTINCT	A.customer_id)	AS	all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT	top_5_customers)	AS	top_customer_count
--outer query--
FROM customer A JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON C.city_id = B.city_id
JOIN country D ON D.country_id = C.country_id
LEFT JOIN
--innerquery--
(Select A.customer_id , A.first_name , A.last_name,
D.country , C.city,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM
customer A JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN city C ON C.city_id = B.city_id
JOIN country D ON D.country_id = C.country_id
JOIN payment E ON E.customer_id = A.customer_id
Where city IN (
SELECT city
FROM customer A
JOIN address E ON A.address_id = E.address_id
JOIN city C ON E.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10
)
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
ORDER BY total_amount_paid desc
LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers
ON	A.customer_id	=	top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP	BY	D.country
ORDER	BY	all_customer_count	DESC
LIMIT	10;
